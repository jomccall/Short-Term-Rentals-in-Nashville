## General Information
Short term rental permitting has, at times, been controversial in Nashville. It is asserted by critics that these permits, usually indicating an Air BnB location, take away from the neighborhood character and drive up housing costs. I was interested to investigate what this permit data could tell me about the different council districts. Since it is an issue tied to government, I felt that political geographies would be appropriate. I decided to look at investment in districts by "outsiders", or permit holders whose home address is outside of the State, the city of Nashville, or the zip code in which their permitted STR (short term rental) property is located.
